# Aerial_Robotics
This course is part of the Robotics specialization on Coursera, offered by the University of Pennsylvania and taught by Vijay Kumar.

# Assignment 1: 1-D Quadrotor Control Solution
I followed the Instructor's instructions to achieve stable hover control and step response of the quadrotor.
Check out controller.m

# Assignment 2: 2-D Quadrotor Control Solution
After tunning the controller weights, the quadrotor was able to smoothly track line and sine wave trajectories with minimal tracking errors in 2D.
Check out controller.m

# Assignment 3: 3-D Quadrotor Control Solution
After defining the trajectory points in traj_generator.m, and implementing a controller function in control.m, optimal tracking of the Line and Helix trajectories was achieved.
